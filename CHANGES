- 0.11 ... Can now provide the optional "4th" (config options) argument
           without *also* having to provide a "3rd" (build directory) argument.
           ie If the third argument is a hash reference, it's assumed to contain
           config options - otherwise it sets the build directory.
 
           Check that only valid config options have been passed via the "config
           options" argument.

           Catch the error (and die) if a non-existent typemap is specified
           in the TYPEMAPS config option.
    
           If the specified build_dir does not exist, die(). Previously, a warning was
           issued and the files written to the current working directory.

- 0.10 ... Module is now called InlineX::CPP2XS (previously Inline::CPP2XS, which is now
           deprecated).
           Now has the same capabilities as its C counterpart (InlineX::C2XS-0.10) - 
           ie can also (optionally) autogenerate the Makefile.PL in addition to the other
           files it has always been capable of generating (namely the .xs file, INLINE.h
           and CPP.map).

- 0.07 ... Inline::CPP2XS born (previously part of Inline::C2XS)
